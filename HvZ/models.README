# Building Stuff #
##################

School 
*just a list of the 7Cs plus Off Campus/Non Student
*It's used to indicate where people go or what building something belongs to

Building
*list of all the buildings and landmarks on campus based on the maps
*added a space for nicknames (so people know that the Coop and SCC are the same or Jungel-Wenklers and JGW)
*lat/lng are so that we can put the point on google maps. That means that latitude is between between -90 and +90 and longitude is between 0 and 180.
*I think lat/lng are actually in the current DB backwards. I can never keep them straight.

Building Kind
*1:N field for types of buildings
*Historically we've just allowed 1 type of building and just gave priority to dorms if it was multiple types.
*That is messy, so we are going to do it correctly

Dorm
*A subclass of buidling
*It keeps a count of residents to reduce DB calls
*It automatically creates a building kind entry for it as a dorm when you save it

Academic
*A subclass of building
*It keeps track of how many people have class in it at various times to reduce DB calls
*It automatically creates a building kind entry for it as an academic building when you save it.
*As far as I can tell, you can't create a building with two subclasses in the UI, so places like oldenborg will have to be done manually

# Game Things #
###############

Game
*Games are the actual events that we run
*start date is mostly important so the DB knows when to start the meals per hour clock

Rule
*Rules are instances of individual rules
*title and description are always visible
*examples, youtube, image, and location are hidden until someone clicks on them
*only buildings should have a location
*the image does appear by default for classes

#################
# Mission Stuff #
#################

Mission
*Events that happen during game days
*lots of things have human_something or zombie_something because the two sides get different versions
*get_title, story, reward, and sms all take visibility into account (so we don't have leaks like last game)

MissionPic
*Mission Pics are pictures that hook up to missions
*Mission Pics have visibility settings independent of the mission's visibility setting because sometimes we show humans and zeds different versions of things

MissionPoint
*Mission Points are so that we can mark off important locations on a map
*Historically we haven't done this at all, but it might be worth adding since not everyone knows the 5Cs all that well
*It lets you indicate what kind of objective happens at the point

Plot
*Story stuff that isn't related to missions
*So far, we've had almost none of it and nobody looked at the timeline page anyway.
*To be visible, the story must both have a visibility that says they can see it and it must be after the reveal time. Reveal time exists so that we can set things to automatically appear.
*This isn't divided into human and zombie versions because there won't necessarily be a 1:1 ratio of human to zombie stories added

################
# Player Stuff #
################

Player
*Player represents an actual real world person
*Player contains extra fields that should be linked to users, but without actually touching users
*This is the way that django recommends adding extra fields to users
*bad_posts and bad_meals are how we moderate players abusing the systems we have

PlayerSetting
*Player settings are any customizations a player wants to make to how the website or SMS interact with them
*Right now it only includes options to customize when they get text messages
*Historically, these settings have never actually been used

PlayerProfile
*Player profiles are for the displays people have on the website
*They get two images to upload (a human one and a zombie one) that change based on the status of their current character
*The visibility settings indicate what biographic information we have on them should be visible and to whom. These fields automatically change when a a player's team changes.

###################
# Character Stuff #
###################
# This is the section I'm most unsure about #

Character
*Characters are the personas that our players LARP as
*This used to be called registrations
*It includes fields for dorm, school, and class year so that we can archive games
*Can eat and increment bad meals are to check if a player has been abusing the system trying to eat. Bad posts are the same but for the forum.

FeedCode
*Feed codes are the codes that people have that represent brains
*It's separated out so that we have the freedom to do more with them than just have 1:1
*When pulled out like this we can have the following
**meals that don't make you a zombie (extra lives)
**meals that don't link to anyone (so they can be rewards)
**meals that are worth more than others (so we can create higher value targets)

Meal
*Meals are how one player can eat another
*They connect a player to a feed code, which only indirectly leads to a player
*To avoid constantly using select_related (and underlying joins) I've included an extra field for eaten, even though it isn't strictly necessary
*Only have eaten equal to none for bonus meals, so we can easily tell whether we should follow a link back.

Classes
*Classes are a way people can indicate when they'll be in what buildings
*They are a new feature that some people said they wanted but I doubt will be used since it'll be difficult to put in the system

###############
# Squad Stuff #
###############

Squad
*Squads are groups of characters
*I linked it to characters so people are free to be in different squads each game

Squad Member
*Squad members are how we put characters into squads
*People can only be in one squad per game
*We might want to set up options for automatically removing someone from a squad or making them "ex" members upon being eaten
*Approve_new is probably going to be used for all moderation activities for a squad. I just can't think of any at the moment.

###############
# Forum Stuff #
###############

Forum Thread
*Threads are top level elements on a forum
*Threads determine visibility of all their children

Forum Post
*Posts are responses on a thread
*Right now we don't have it set up to allow posts in response to other posts even though some people requested that

################
# Achievements #
################
# This is another section that may need to be rethought #

Award
*Awards are things that people can earn in a game
*Multiple people can get the same award
*People can get multiple awards
*The description is an overview of the award

Achievement
*Achievements are instances of characters earning an award
*The description field here is for how they earned that award

###############################
# Efficiency Stuff for Graphs #
###############################
# I would like feedback from someone who knows what they are doing on here #

Meals Per Hour
*A count for the number of meals that maps to an hour
*It recalculates this number every time a meal is added. I used to have it increment, but then I remembered that sometimes meals are changed, not just created.
